> Heuristic Optimization using Genetic Algorithm to find the best distance combinations from a given (x,y) points.

Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are optimization algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection. They use techniques like selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve a population of potential solutions towards an optimal or near-optimal solution. In the case of Flight Selection, GAs can be used to find the best combination of flights based on various factors like cost, duration, and layovers.
