# The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

**with Genetic Algorithm**
> Imagine you have a set of cities represented by their (x, y) coordinates on a Cartesian plane. The goal is to find the shortest route that visits all these cities exactly once and returns to the starting city. Let's illustrate this with an example:

> City A: (0, 0)
> 
> City B: (2, 4)
> 
> City C: (5, 2)


> To tackle this problem, i followed these steps:

> Defined a Fitness Function and generated an Initial Population;

> Developed a genetic algorithm that evolves this population over multiple generations, included a selection, crossover (recombination), and mutation operations.

Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are optimization algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection. They use techniques like selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve a population of potential solutions towards an optimal or near-optimal solution. In the case of Flight Selection, GAs can be used to find the best combination of flights based on various factors like cost, duration, and layovers.
