# The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

**with Genetic Algorithm**
> Imagine you have a set of cities represented by their (x, y) coordinates on a Cartesian plane. The goal is to find the shortest route that visits all these cities exactly once and returns to the starting city. Let's illustrate this with an example:

> City A: (0, 0)
> City B: (2, 4)
> City C: (5, 2)


> To tackle this problem, you can follow these steps:

> Define a Fitness Function: Create a fitness function that calculates the total length of a route. The fitness should be minimized, meaning a shorter route is better.

> Generate an Initial Population: Start with an initial population of potential solutions (routes) for the traveling salesman problem. Each solution is essentially a permutation of the cities.

> Implement a Genetic Algorithm: Develop a genetic algorithm that evolves this population over multiple generations. The algorithm should include selection, crossover (recombination), and mutation operations.

> Run the Genetic Algorithm: Execute the genetic algorithm for a fixed number of generations. Throughout the process, keep track of the best individual found (the shortest route).

> Present the Results: Finally, present the results, including the best route found and its length.

Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are optimization algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection. They use techniques like selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve a population of potential solutions towards an optimal or near-optimal solution. In the case of Flight Selection, GAs can be used to find the best combination of flights based on various factors like cost, duration, and layovers.
